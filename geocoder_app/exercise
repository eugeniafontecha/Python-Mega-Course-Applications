This is a project

Build a Flask webapp  that expects the user to upload a csv file containing an "Address" column and, 
when the "Submit" button is pressed, prints a table that contains the same information plus two new 
columns: Latitude and Longitud.
If the csv file doesn't have a column named "Address" o "address" it shows an error message to the user.
